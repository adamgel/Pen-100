Pen-100 CTF
This repository is in reference to the Off Sec pen-100 course. For my own reference or anyone making their way through their CTF sections, I'm jotting down hints here to help you on your way. As with anything, try to find the answer on your own. Once you're ready to give up, try a little more. These hints are just to set you in the right direction. I will not be posting the answers but just general guidelines.

A couple helpful tips of general advice:
-Try thinking outside the box, take a step back
-Try different perspectives of attack
